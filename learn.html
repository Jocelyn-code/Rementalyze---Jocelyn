    </header>
    <main class="p2">
      <p>A stigma can be a harsh and occasionally unfair societal attitude toward an individual or group that demeans them due to a perceived flaw in their existence or distinctiveness. Pressure from friends, family, workplace, and society at large can be applied on those who have mental problems. Groups have the power to politicize stigma. It may be challenging for people with mental illnesses to get help, fit in with society, and lead happy, comfortable lives. Stereotypes, which are typically incorrect, unfavorable, and derogatory views or portrayals of entire groups of people, can contribute to the stigma around mental health.
      </p>
      
      <p>The term "mental health," which is also used to describe emotional health, broadly refers to our general psychological well being. It may include your self-perception, the core of your relationships, and your emotional control and ability to deal with challenges. Being injury- or illness-free is a condition of being in good physical health. A healthy diet, a healthy weight, dental health, personal cleanliness, and sleep are just a few examples of the many topics it might address. For total wellbeing, physical fitness is essential. The relationship between physical and mental health is complicated, but the solution is straightforward: for your body to work effectively and for you to lead a happy and healthy life, you need to be in good physical and mental health. It's acceptable to choose to concentrate on one task over another if you are having trouble in one particular area. Just bear in mind how they are interconnected and how crucial it is to maintain your physical and mental wellness.
      </p>

      <p>More people will be able to seek help if the stigma is removed. It is possible to sort through the situation with the assistance of trained, qualified, and objective people and groups in order to prevent things from getting worse or reaching a crisis point. Before assisting a person in seeking therapy, no one should wait for signs of drug or alcohol misuse, cutting or other self-harming behaviors, food abuse (under- or overeating), or a suicide attempt. Imagine if we could reduce the suicide rate simply by making more people feel comfortable seeking assistance sooner. Some ways include being open about your experience, not shaming others who suffer through mental illness, and treating mental health as we treat a common cold.
