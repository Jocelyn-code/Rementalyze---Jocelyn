        <p>Our Happy Path is committed to meeting the needs of people who are dealing with mental illness and advancing everyone's general
          mental health. We offer one-stop access to information about mental health and mental health issues from the US government. 
        </p>
        
        <p>This website was developed by a person who struggles with mental illness in order to inspire people everywhere to use the tools offered to seek
          assistance for themselves. Our objective is to end the stigmatization that is imposed on people by those who do not completely appreciate the value
          of mental health.
